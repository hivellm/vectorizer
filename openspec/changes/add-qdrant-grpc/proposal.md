# Qdrant gRPC Interface Proposal

## Why

Qdrant provides a high-performance gRPC interface for vector operations. Implementing gRPC compatibility enables high-throughput applications and better integration with gRPC-based systems.

## What Changes

- **ADDED**: Complete Qdrant gRPC service implementation
- **ADDED**: gRPC collection operations
- **ADDED**: gRPC vector operations
- **ADDED**: gRPC search operations
- **ADDED**: gRPC streaming support

## Impact

- Affected specs: `api-rest`, `vector-database`
- Affected code: `src/server/`, `src/api/grpc/`
- Breaking changes: None (additive only)
- Migration: Existing Vectorizer API remains unchanged
