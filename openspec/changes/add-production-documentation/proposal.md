# Add Production Documentation

**Change ID**: `add-production-documentation`  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Target Version**: 1.3.0

---

## Why

Developers attempting production deployments lack comprehensive guidance:
- No pre-production checklist
- Missing capacity planning guidelines
- No troubleshooting runbooks
- Limited Kubernetes/Docker examples
- No disaster recovery procedures

This results in failed deployments, support tickets, and frustrated users.

---

## What Changes

- Create comprehensive `docs/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` (300+ lines)
- Add capacity planning tables for various scales
- Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Document monitoring and alerting setup
- Create runbooks for common issues
- Add disaster recovery procedures

---

## Impact

### Affected Capabilities
- **documentation** (MODIFIED - enhanced)

### Affected Code
- `docs/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` - NEW
- `docs/runbooks/` - NEW directory
- `k8s/` - NEW Kubernetes manifests (optional)

### Breaking Changes
None - documentation only.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Production guide covers all deployment scenarios
- ✅ 5+ runbooks for common issues
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests tested
- ✅ Monitoring setup guide complete
- ✅ Zero support tickets for documented issues
