# Qdrant Compatibility Design

## Context

Vectorizer needs to achieve full compatibility with Qdrant API to enable seamless migration and interoperability. This involves implementing Qdrant's REST API, gRPC interface, and client library compatibility while maintaining Vectorizer's existing functionality.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Complete Qdrant REST API v1.14.x compatibility
- Qdrant gRPC interface compatibility
- Official Qdrant client library compatibility
- Seamless migration from Qdrant to Vectorizer
- Maintain existing Vectorizer API functionality

### Non-Goals
- Replacing Vectorizer's core architecture
- Changing Vectorizer's internal data structures
- Breaking existing Vectorizer functionality
- Implementing Qdrant-specific optimizations that conflict with Vectorizer's design

## Decisions

### Decision: API Compatibility Layer
**What**: Implement a compatibility layer that translates Qdrant API calls to Vectorizer operations
**Why**: Maintains Vectorizer's architecture while providing Qdrant compatibility
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Direct Qdrant implementation (rejected: would require complete rewrite)
- Proxy to Qdrant (rejected: adds complexity and latency)

### Decision: Dual API Support
**What**: Support both Vectorizer and Qdrant APIs simultaneously
**Why**: Enables gradual migration and maintains backward compatibility
**Alternatives considered**:
- Qdrant-only mode (rejected: breaks existing users)
- Vectorizer-only mode (rejected: doesn't achieve compatibility goal)

### Decision: Schema Translation
**What**: Translate between Qdrant and Vectorizer data schemas
**Why**: Enables data compatibility without changing internal structures
**Alternatives considered**:
- Unified schema (rejected: too complex)
- Separate storage (rejected: inefficient)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Implement efficient translation layer with minimal overhead

### Risk: API Drift
**Mitigation**: Regular compatibility testing with Qdrant client libraries

### Risk: Maintenance Complexity
**Mitigation**: Clear separation between compatibility layer and core functionality

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Compatibility
1. Implement Qdrant REST API endpoints
2. Add request/response format translation
3. Test with Qdrant client libraries

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Implement gRPC interface
2. Add clustering and distribution support
3. Implement advanced search features

### Phase 3: Client Compatibility
1. Test with all official Qdrant clients
2. Add migration tools
3. Create documentation and examples

## Open Questions

- Should we implement Qdrant-specific optimizations?
- How to handle Qdrant features not present in Vectorizer?
- What level of performance parity is required?
