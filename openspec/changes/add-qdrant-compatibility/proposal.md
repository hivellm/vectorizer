# Qdrant Compatibility Proposal

## Why

Vectorizer currently provides its own vector database implementation, but lacks compatibility with the industry-standard Qdrant API. This limits adoption and integration with existing Qdrant-based applications and tools. Adding Qdrant API compatibility will enable seamless migration and interoperability.

## What Changes

- **ADDED**: Complete Qdrant REST API compatibility layer
- **ADDED**: Qdrant collection management endpoints
- **ADDED**: Qdrant vector operations (upsert, search, delete)
- **ADDED**: Qdrant payload filtering and querying
- **ADDED**: Qdrant clustering and sharding support
- **ADDED**: Qdrant gRPC interface compatibility
- **ADDED**: Qdrant client library compatibility
- **ADDED**: Qdrant configuration migration tools

## Impact

- Affected specs: `vector-database`, `api-rest`, `collections`, `search`
- Affected code: `src/server/`, `src/api/`, `src/db/`, `src/models/`
- Breaking changes: None (additive only)
- Migration: Existing Vectorizer API remains unchanged
