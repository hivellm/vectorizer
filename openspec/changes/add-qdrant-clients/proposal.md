# Qdrant Client Compatibility Proposal

## Why

Official Qdrant client libraries (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go) need to work seamlessly with Vectorizer to enable easy migration and adoption.

## What Changes

- **ADDED**: Python client compatibility testing and validation
- **ADDED**: JavaScript client compatibility testing and validation
- **ADDED**: Rust client compatibility testing and validation
- **ADDED**: Go client compatibility testing and validation
- **ADDED**: Client integration test suite

## Impact

- Affected specs: `api-rest`, `client-sdks`
- Affected code: `tests/`, `client-sdks/`
- Breaking changes: None (additive only)
- Migration: Existing Vectorizer clients remain unchanged
