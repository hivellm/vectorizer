# Bend Integration for Vectorizer

This directory contains the Proof of Concept (POC) for integrating Bend with the Vectorizer project to enable automatic parallelization of vector operations.

## What is Bend?

Bend is a massively parallel, high-level programming language written in Rust. It automatically parallelizes programs without requiring explicit parallel constructs, making it ideal for accelerating vector operations.

## Key Benefits for Vectorizer

1. **Automatic Parallelization**: Bend automatically parallelizes recursive functions
2. **CUDA Support**: Native GPU acceleration for vector operations
3. **Rust Integration**: Easy integration with our existing Rust codebase
4. **Performance**: Potential 10-100x speedup for parallelizable operations

## Files Structure

```
examples/bend/
├── vector_search.bend    # Complex vector similarity search example
└── simple_test.bend      # Basic test to verify Bend installation

tests/bend/
└── integration_test.rs   # Rust integration tests

src/bend/
└── mod.rs               # Bend integration module
```

## Installation Requirements

1. Install Bend in WSL Ubuntu 24.04:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   bend --version
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Test
```bash
bend run-c examples/bend/simple_test.bend
```

### Vector Search (CUDA)
```bash
bend run-cu examples/bend/vector_search.bend
```

### Vector Search (CPU)
```bash
bend run-c examples/bend/vector_search.bend
```

## Integration Status

- ✅ Basic module structure created
- ✅ Simple test program created
- ✅ Vector search example created
- ✅ Rust integration module created
- ⏳ Bend installation verification
- ⏳ Performance benchmarking
- ⏳ Production integration

## Performance Expectations

Based on Bend's capabilities, we expect:

- **Vector Similarity Search**: 10-50x speedup with CUDA
- **Batch Operations**: 5-20x speedup with automatic parallelization
- **Large Dataset Processing**: Significant improvement for recursive operations

## Next Steps

1. Test Bend installation in WSL
2. Run performance benchmarks
3. Integrate with existing vector operations
4. Add CUDA support configuration
5. Implement dynamic Bend code generation

## Notes

- Bend programs are written in functional style
- Automatic parallelization works best with recursive functions
- CUDA acceleration requires compatible GPU
- Integration is designed to be optional (fallback to Rust implementation)
