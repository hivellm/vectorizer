4. **Optimized HNSW**: Efficient approximate search algorithm

### Technical Risks
1. **Implementation Complexity**: HNSW + multiple bindings
2. **Concurrency**: Shared state management

- Test compatibility with server APIs

### For TypeScript LLM (Client SDK)
- Review client SDK architecture (no local processing)
- Validate API key integration and async operations
- Evaluate LangChain.js integration with server client
- Test compatibility with server APIs

### For Security LLM
- Review API key management and storage security

## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive specification for a secure, high-performance vector database with proper client-server architecture. The design eliminates the conceptual error of local database processing by centralizing all vector operations on the server while providing lightweight, authenticated client SDKs.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Client-Server Model**: Server handles all processing, SDKs are thin clients
- **Mandatory Authentication**: API keys required for all operations
- **Local Dashboard**: Secure key management accessible only from localhost
- **Flexible Deployment**: Internal network or cloud configurations
- **Native Embeddings**: Built-in models avoid external dependencies
- **Memory Optimization**: Quantization support for large-scale deployments

The modular design enables single-codebase maintenance across multiple language SDKs while ensuring enterprise-grade security and performance.

   - **Priority 1**: Core foundation (server, HNSW, persistence)
   - **Priority 2**: REST APIs and authentication
   - **Priority 3**: Testing and quality assurance
   - **Priority 4**: Client SDKs (Python, TypeScript)
   - **Priority 5**: Production features (dashboard, CLI)

3. **Experimental Features Separated**:
   - **UMICP Integration**: Moved to Phase 6+ (experimental)
   - **CUDA/GPU Acceleration**: Clearly marked as experimental
   - **Advanced ML Integrations**: Deferred until after core is solid

   - Cannot build, run, or test currently
   - All benchmarks are theoretical projections
   - Installation instructions updated to reflect reality

### Impact:
- **Honest Documentation**: No longer misleading about project status
