## ðŸš« Explicitly Deprioritized

The following features are **intentionally delayed** until after the foundation is solid:

1. **UMICP Integration**: Experimental feature for federated embeddings
2. **GPU/CUDA Acceleration**: Performance optimization, not core functionality
3. **Advanced ML Integrations**: Requires stable base system
4. **Distributed/Clustering**: Single-node optimization first
5. **Advanced Compression**: LZ4 basic compression first
6. **Complex UI Features**: Basic dashboard first

**Rationale**: Focus on delivering a working, reliable vector database before advanced optimizations.

---

## ðŸ“Š Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **HNSW Implementation Complexity**: Use proven library (hnsw_rs), not custom implementation
- **Multi-language Bindings**: Start with HTTP clients, add native bindings later
- **Performance Targets**: Set realistic targets based on similar systems

### **Scope Risks**
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to roadmap, defer experimental features
- **Perfectionism**: Ship working solution, optimize iteratively
- **Complex Integrations**: Build after core is proven

### **Resource Risks**  
- **Team Size**: Minimum viable team, add specialists for Phase 6+
- **Timeline Pressure**: Better to deliver solid foundation than rush features
- **Technology Choices**: Use proven libraries, avoid experimental dependencies

---

## ðŸ”„ Iteration Strategy

### **Monthly Reviews**
- Assess progress against milestones
- Adjust timeline based on actual development speed
- Reprioritize features based on user feedback

### **Continuous Validation**
- Regular performance testing
- User feedback integration
- Documentation updates
- Security reviews

### **Adaptive Planning**
- Move experimental features to later phases if needed
- Add features based on user demand
- Respond to ecosystem changes (new libraries, etc.)
