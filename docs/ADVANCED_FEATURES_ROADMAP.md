## üöÄ **Feature 1: Intelligent Cache Management & Incremental Indexing**

### Problem Statement
Currently, every server restart triggers a complete reindexing of all collections, causing:
- **Slow Startup**: 30-60 seconds before system becomes usable
- **Resource Waste**: Unnecessary CPU/memory consumption for unchanged data
- **Poor User Experience**: Delayed response times during startup

### Technical Solution

#### 1.1 Cache-First Loading Strategy
```rust
// Proposed Architecture
pub struct IntelligentCacheManager {
    cache_metadata: CacheMetadata,
    incremental_tracker: IncrementalTracker,
    file_watcher: FileWatcher,
}

pub struct CacheMetadata {
    last_indexed: DateTime<Utc>,
    file_hashes: HashMap<PathBuf, String>,
    collection_versions: HashMap<String, u64>,
    indexing_strategy: IndexingStrategy,
}
```

#### 1.2 Incremental Indexing Engine
- **File Change Detection**: Monitor file modification timestamps and content hashes
- **Delta Processing**: Only process changed/new files since last indexing
- **Smart Reindexing**: Full reindexing only when embedding models change
- **Background Updates**: Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals

#### 1.3 Implementation Strategy
1. **Cache Validation**: Verify cache integrity on startup
2. **Fast Load**: Load existing vectors immediately (sub-second startup)
3. **Background Sync**: Detect and process changes in background
4. **Configurable Triggers**: Manual, scheduled, or event-driven reindexing

### Benefits
- **Sub-second Startup**: System becomes usable immediately
- **Resource Efficiency**: 90% reduction in startup CPU usage
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes detected and processed automatically
- **Configurable Behavior**: Full control over indexing strategies

## üîÑ **Feature 2: Dynamic Vector Management via MCP**

### Problem Statement
Current MCP implementation is read-only, limiting real-time knowledge updates:
- **Static Knowledge**: No way to add new information during conversations
- **Stale Context**: Outdated information persists until full reindexing
- **Limited Interactivity**: Cannot learn from user interactions

### Technical Solution

#### 2.1 MCP Vector Operations
```rust
// New MCP Tools
pub enum MCPVectorOperation {
    AddVector {
        collection: String,
        content: String,
        metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
        embedding_model: Option<String>,
    },
    UpdateVector {
        vector_id: String,
        content: String,
        metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
    },
    DeleteVector {
        vector_id: String,
    },
    CreateCollection {
        name: String,
        description: String,
        config: CollectionConfig,
    },
}
```

#### 2.2 Real-time Vector Updates
- **Live Indexing**: Add vectors without server restart
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Attach conversation context, timestamps, user info
- **Embedding Flexibility**: Support multiple embedding models per collection

    extractors: Vec<Box<dyn ContentExtractor>>,
    summarizers: Vec<Box<dyn Summarizer>>,
    context_managers: Vec<Box<dyn ContextManager>>,
}

pub enum SummarizationLevel {
    Keyword,      // Extract key terms and concepts
    Sentence,     // Summarize individual sentences
    Paragraph,    // Summarize paragraphs and sections
    Document,     // Summarize entire documents
    Collection,   // Summarize entire collections
}
```
