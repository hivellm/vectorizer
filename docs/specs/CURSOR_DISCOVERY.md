# Cursor-Like Discovery System

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01

---

## Overview

Cursor-level intelligent discovery system with advanced multi-query search, semantic reranking, and context generation capabilities.

---

## Core Features

### Multi-Query Generation
- Automatically expands user queries into 4-8 related queries
- Domain-specific knowledge expansion
- Technical term extraction
- Synonym and related term expansion

### Semantic Reranking
- 6-factor scoring system
- Weighted combination of multiple signals
- Superior relevance vs basic similarity

### Intelligent Deduplication
- Content hashing for exact duplicates
- Semantic similarity for near-duplicates
- MMR diversification

---

## Tools

**discover**: Complete discovery pipeline with filtering, scoring, expansion, search, ranking, and prompt generation

**Parameters**:
```json
{
  "query": "user question",
  "include_collections": ["pattern*"],
  "exclude_collections": ["*-test"],
  "broad_k": 50,
  "focus_k": 15,
  "max_bullets": 20
}
```

**Returns**: Structured LLM-ready prompt with evidence
