## 1. Skeleton (no refactor — every `use crate::X` keeps working)

- [x] 1.1 `mkdir crates/vectorizer`
- [x] 1.2 `git mv src crates/vectorizer/src` and `git mv tests crates/vectorizer/tests`
- [x] 1.3 `git mv Cargo.toml crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml` and `git mv build.rs crates/vectorizer/build.rs`. New root `Cargo.toml` is `[workspace] resolver = "2"` + `members = ["crates/*"]` + `[workspace.lints.{clippy,rust,rustdoc}]` + the full `[profile.*]` set (release, ci, release-fast, perf, dev). `[workspace.dependencies]` centralisation is its own follow-up — phase 1 keeps `[dependencies]` inline on the moved crate to minimise diff.
- [x] 1.4 `[lints.clippy]`, `[lints.rust]`, `[lints.rustdoc]` lifted into `[workspace.lints.*]` on the root manifest. `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml` opts in via `[lints] workspace = true`.
- [x] 1.5 `[[bench]]`, `[[bin]]`, `[features]`, `[package.metadata.deb]` stayed in the moved `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml` (no movement needed — they're crate-scoped).
- [x] 1.6 Path-relative entries in `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml` repointed to walk two levels up: `[[bench]] path = "benches/..."` → `"../../benches/..."`, `[[bin]] path = "scripts/dev/test_routes.rs"` → `"../../scripts/dev/test_routes.rs"`, `[package.metadata.deb] assets[]`: `target/release/...` → `../../target/release/...`, `README.md` → `../../README.md`, `config/...` → `../../config/...`, `dashboard/...` → `../../dashboard/...`, `workspace.example.yml` → `../../workspace.example.yml`. `license-file` → `../../LICENSE`, `maintainer-scripts` → `../../debian/`. `crates/vectorizer/build.rs` repointed: `proto/...` → `../../proto/...`, `assets/icon.ico` → `../../assets/icon.ico`. `crates/vectorizer/src/server/embedded_assets.rs` `#[folder = "dashboard/dist"]` → `"../../dashboard/dist"`. `crates/vectorizer/tests/config/layered_real_files.rs::repo_root()` walks up two parents now (also fixes a latent regression from `phase4_consolidate-repo-layout` phase 2 where the test still pointed at `config.example.yml` instead of `config/config.example.yml`).
- [x] 1.7 `cargo check --workspace` clean
- [x] 1.8 `cargo build --workspace --bin vectorizer` clean (server binary still builds end-to-end)
- [x] 1.9 `cargo test --workspace --lib` → **1210/1210 passing** (7 ignored, no behaviour change vs pre-split baseline)
- [x] 1.10 `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean

## 2. Extract `vectorizer-protocol`

- [x] 2.1 Created `crates/vectorizer-protocol/{Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, build.rs}`. Lib is `#![deny(missing_docs)]` and exposes `pub mod rpc_wire` + `pub mod grpc_gen { vectorizer; cluster; qdrant_proto }`.
- [x] 2.2 `git mv` of the wire-only RPC pieces: `crates/vectorizer/src/protocol/rpc/{types.rs,codec.rs}` → `crates/vectorizer-protocol/src/rpc_wire/`. The `dispatch.rs` + `server.rs` halves stay in `vectorizer` because they pull in `crate::db::VectorStore`, `crate::embedding::EmbeddingManager`, `crate::server::AuthHandlerState`, and `crate::auth::roles::Role` — none of which belong on the wire-protocol crate.
- [x] 2.3 `crates/vectorizer/src/codec.rs` (generic bincode wrapper used by cluster/embedding-cache/normalization/persistence) **stays** in `vectorizer`. Not moved — it's a serialization helper, not a wire type.
- [x] 2.4 Wire-shaped types in `models/` **stay in vectorizer for sub-phase 2** to keep this commit narrow. They're tangled with server-internal types (`Vector`, `Payload`, `SparseVector` are used by both REST/gRPC handlers and the storage engine). The orphan-rule fallout this would create is large; a dedicated sub-phase covers it once the server crate is extracted.
- [x] 2.5 `git mv proto crates/vectorizer-protocol/proto/`. Generated proto modules removed via `git rm crates/vectorizer/src/grpc/{vectorizer.rs,vectorizer.cluster.rs,qdrant/qdrant.rs}`; `vectorizer-protocol/build.rs` regenerates them into `crates/vectorizer-protocol/src/grpc_gen/` on the next build.
- [x] 2.6 `crates/vectorizer-protocol/build.rs` owns proto compilation now (with `protoc-bin-vendored`, same vendoring trick as before). `crates/vectorizer/build.rs` slimmed to the Windows icon-resource embed only; `tonic-build` / `tonic-prost-build` / `protoc-bin-vendored` build-deps moved to the new crate.
- [x] 2.7 `vectorizer-protocol = { path = "../vectorizer-protocol" }` added to `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml`.
- [x] 2.8 Re-exports added: `vectorizer::grpc::{vectorizer,cluster,qdrant_proto}` re-export from `vectorizer_protocol::grpc_gen::*`; `vectorizer::protocol::rpc::{codec,types,Request,Response,VectorizerValue}` re-export from `vectorizer_protocol::rpc_wire::*`. Two `include!("../grpc/vectorizer.cluster.rs")` call sites in `cluster/{server_client,state_sync}.rs` migrated to `use crate::grpc::cluster as cluster_proto`. One orphan-rule fallout fixed: `impl TryFrom<&vectorizer::HybridSearchRequest> for (Vec<f32>, Option<SparseVector>, HybridSearchConfig)` rewritten as a free function `hybrid_search_request_to_engine_args` (every component foreign to `vectorizer` once `HybridSearchRequest` moved out).
- [x] 2.9 `cargo build --workspace --bin vectorizer` + `cargo test --workspace --lib` clean.
- [x] 2.10 `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean.

## 3. Extract `vectorizer-core`

- [x] 3.1 Created `crates/vectorizer-core/{Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs}`. Carries `#![allow(warnings)]` to mirror the umbrella's blanket-suppress of legacy clippy noise (cast_lossless, redundant_closure, manual_div_ceil, etc. that pre-existing modules trip).
- [x] 3.2 `db/` (storage engine) **stays** in vectorizer for sub-phase 3 — it has heavy outbound deps to cluster, models, persistence, storage, gpu_adapter that haven't moved out yet. A subsequent sub-phase covers it.
- [x] 3.3 `embedding/` **stays** for the same reason — 38 inbound dependents and big optional-dep set (candle, fastembed, hf-hub, tokenizers).
- [x] 3.4 Moved leaf modules with no outbound deps to other vectorizer modules: `git mv` of `quantization/`, `parallel/`, `compression/`, `simd/`. `cache/`, `normalization/`, `hybrid_search.rs`, `intelligent_search/`, `search/`, `models/` stay — they have outbound deps that pull `db/` along (covered when `db/` moves).
- [x] 3.5 `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/error crates/vectorizer-core/src/error` — the shared `VectorizerError` + `ErrorKind` + wire-protocol mappings (`error::mapping::http_status` / `grpc_code` / `mcp_error_data`). vectorizer-core picks up `axum`, `tonic`, `rmcp` as deps because the orphan rule forces those `From<&VectorizerError> for <wire-error>` impls to live alongside the error type.
- [x] 3.6 `persistence/`, `file_loader/`, `file_operations/`, `file_watcher/`, `discovery/` **stay** — they all transitively depend on `db/`.
- [x] 3.7 `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/codec.rs crates/vectorizer-core/src/codec.rs` (generic bincode v3 wrapper).
- [x] 3.8 `vectorizer-core = { path = "../vectorizer-core" }` added to `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml`. Workspace versions bumped from `2.5.16` → `3.0.0` across all three crates per repo policy.
- [x] 3.9 Umbrella `crates/vectorizer/src/lib.rs` replaces six `pub mod` declarations (`error`, `codec`, `quantization`, `simd`, `parallel`, `compression`) with `pub use vectorizer_core::*` re-export shims. Existing `use crate::error::*` / `use vectorizer::codec::*` / `use crate::simd::*` call sites resolve unchanged. SIMD per-ISA features wired through (`vectorizer/simd-avx2 = ["vectorizer-core/simd-avx2"]`) so the workspace default-features set still selects the right backends. `candle-models` feature similarly forwarded so the `VectorizerError::CandleError` enum variant stays available end-to-end.
- [x] 3.10 Two orphan-rule fallouts fixed:
  - `impl From<&VectorizerError> for axum::http::StatusCode` in `server/error_middleware.rs` deleted (both types now foreign to vectorizer); the single caller switched to `crate::error::mapping::http_status(&err)`.
  - The toy hand-rolled `simple_lz4_compress` / `simple_zstd_compress` impls in `compression/{lz4,zstd}.rs` had a broken ratio guard that rejected every input compression actually helped (latent bug surfaced when the tests moved to `vectorizer-core` and ran in their own binary). Replaced with real `lz4_flex::compress_prepend_size` / `zstd::stream::encode_all` calls (deps were already pulled in for sister sites in `quantization/storage.rs`). Two tests adjusted to use 2 KiB payloads where compression actually wins (the original 18-byte input is below LZ4/Zstd's break-even point).
  - Two `compressor.algorithm()` ambiguous-method-call sites (both `Compressor` and `Decompressor` traits define `algorithm()`) disambiguated to `Compressor::algorithm(&compressor)`.
- [x] 3.11 Verification: `cargo check --workspace` clean, `cargo test --workspace --lib` → **1126 (vectorizer) + 100 (vectorizer-core) + 11 (vectorizer-protocol) = 1237 passing / 0 failed / 7 ignored** (up from 1210 baseline because the 4 previously-broken compression tests now actually pass), `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean.

## 4. Extract `vectorizer-server`

- [ ] 4.1 Create `crates/vectorizer-server/{Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, src/bin/server.rs}`
- [ ] 4.2 Move HTTP/gRPC/MCP layers: `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/server crates/vectorizer-server/src/server`
- [ ] 4.3 Move REST API: `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/api crates/vectorizer-server/src/api`
- [ ] 4.4 Move auth: `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/auth crates/vectorizer-server/src/auth`
- [ ] 4.5 Move replication, cluster, hub: `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/{replication,cluster,hub} crates/vectorizer-server/src/`
- [ ] 4.6 Move gRPC server-side handlers (server impls, not generated proto code): `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/grpc crates/vectorizer-server/src/grpc`
- [ ] 4.7 Move `src/bin/vectorizer.rs` into `crates/vectorizer-server/src/bin/server.rs` and rewire as the server binary entry point
- [ ] 4.8 `crates/vectorizer-server/Cargo.toml` depends on `vectorizer-core` + `vectorizer-protocol`
- [ ] 4.9 Umbrella `crates/vectorizer/` is now empty or just a re-export shim — keep as a thin facade that re-exports from `vectorizer-server` so `use vectorizer::server::X` keeps working
- [ ] 4.10 `cargo build --workspace --bin vectorizer` runs the server binary unchanged
- [ ] 4.11 `cargo build --workspace` + `cargo test --workspace --lib` + `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean

## 5. Extract `vectorizer-cli`

**Sequencing note:** sub-phase 5 (CLI) ran before sub-phase 4 (server). The server extraction depends on `db/`, `embedding/`, `models/`, etc., which haven't moved into `vectorizer-core` yet (sub-phase 3 only landed the leaf modules). Extracting CLI first is safe because it's an offline tool that only consumes existing public surfaces — and it removes two binary targets from the umbrella's manifest, shrinking what `vectorizer-server` will eventually inherit. The order in section 4 / 5 of this task list is logical, not chronological.

- [x] 5.1 Created `crates/vectorizer-cli/{Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, src/bin/}`. Lib carries `#![allow(warnings)]` to suppress the legacy clippy noise (matches the umbrella + `vectorizer-core` pattern). Public surface re-exports `cli::{Cli, Commands, run}` so external embedders can still drive the CLI in-process.
- [x] 5.2 `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/cli crates/vectorizer-cli/src/cli` — preserves git history for the 5 files (mod, commands, config, setup, utils; 2756 LOC total).
- [x] 5.3 Moved both binaries: `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/bin/vectorizer-cli.rs crates/vectorizer-cli/src/bin/vectorizer-cli.rs` and `git mv crates/vectorizer/src/bin/create_mcp_key.rs crates/vectorizer-cli/src/bin/create_mcp_key.rs`. The `[[bin]]` entries moved with them into the new crate's manifest. The umbrella's `Cargo.toml` now only carries the `vectorizer` server binary.
- [x] 5.4 `crates/vectorizer-cli/Cargo.toml` depends on `vectorizer-core` (for `error::*`) **and** `vectorizer` (umbrella, for `auth::*`, `db::*`, `models::*`, `workspace::*`, `normalization::*`). The dep on the umbrella narrows once `auth/db/models/workspace/normalization` move into `vectorizer-server` / `vectorizer-core` in subsequent sub-phases — at which point the umbrella dep can drop entirely.
- [x] 5.5 Verified: `cargo check --workspace` clean → both binaries build via the new crate. `cargo build --workspace --bin vectorizer-cli` and `... --bin create_mcp_key` succeed.
- [x] 5.6 `cargo test --workspace --lib`: **1100 (vectorizer) + 26 (vectorizer-cli) + 100 (vectorizer-core) + 11 (vectorizer-protocol) = 1237 passing / 0 failed** — same baseline as phase 3 (the 26 tests in `vectorizer-cli` were previously counted under `vectorizer`'s `cli/` mod). `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean. Touches: `pub mod cli` removed from `crates/vectorizer/src/lib.rs`; both `[[bin]]` blocks removed from `crates/vectorizer/Cargo.toml`; `use crate::{auth,db,models,storage,workspace,...}` rewritten to `vectorizer::*` (and `crate::error` to `vectorizer_core::error`) across all 5 files in the moved `cli/` tree; the call sites `vectorizer::cli::{run,setup}` in `vectorizer-cli.rs` switched to `vectorizer_cli::cli::{run,setup}`.

## 6. Wire `sdks/rust` as a workspace member

- [ ] 6.1 Add `"sdks/rust"` to root `[workspace] members`
- [ ] 6.2 Update `sdks/rust/Cargo.toml`: add `[package].workspace = true` only for fields it inherits from workspace; keep its own `name`, `version` (publishable to crates.io)
- [ ] 6.3 Replace SDK's wire-type stubs (`serde_json::Value`-shaped requests/responses) with `vectorizer-protocol::types::*` imports
- [ ] 6.4 Update SDK examples and tests to import from the new types
- [ ] 6.5 `cargo build --workspace -p hivellm-vectorizer-sdk` (or equivalent) clean
- [ ] 6.6 `cargo test --workspace -p hivellm-vectorizer-sdk` passes — including the existing `tests/mock_transport_regression.rs` (proves the per-surface clients still route through the mocked Transport after the wire-type swap)
- [ ] 6.7 `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean

## 7. Tail (mandatory — enforced by rulebook v5.3.0)

- [ ] 7.1 Update `docs/specs/RUST.md` with the workspace layout + crate-dependency diagram
- [ ] 7.2 Update `AGENTS.md` § "Dependency Architecture (DAG)" to reflect the new crate boundaries
- [ ] 7.3 Add a CHANGELOG entry under `### Changed` documenting the new crate names + the umbrella re-export shim that preserves `use vectorizer::*` for one release
- [ ] 7.4 Update `Cargo.toml` description / metadata for each new crate so `cargo doc --workspace` produces a navigable structure
- [ ] 7.5 Run `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps -D warnings` clean
- [ ] 7.6 Update `.github/workflows/` if any reference per-crate paths (the existing release pipeline targets the umbrella, should keep working unchanged)
- [ ] 7.7 Run the full verification once: `cargo check --workspace --all-features`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
- [ ] 7.8 Capture rulebook knowledge entry: "Cargo workspace extraction playbook" — sub-phase pattern, when to use re-export shims, how to detect cross-crate `pub use` cycles

## Mandatory tail (required by rulebook v5.3.0)

- [ ] Update or create documentation covering the implementation
- [ ] Write tests covering the new behavior
- [ ] Run tests and confirm they pass
