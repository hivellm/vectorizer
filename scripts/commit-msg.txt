feat: migrate all println! to tracing for structured logging

- Replace all println! and eprintln! with tracing macros across entire codebase
- Add tracing imports to test files and benchmarks
- Update documentation examples to use tracing
- Keep println! in build.rs (build scripts cannot use tracing)
- Keep println!() empty in ProgressBar (formatting required)
- Fix tracing::info!() calls to use info!("") instead
- Update dockerhub-readme.md with latest features and Docker Hub links
- Add structured logging configuration examples
- Update API examples with text search and graph operations
