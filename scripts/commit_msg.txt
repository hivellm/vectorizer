Add hybrid search and Qdrant compatibility to JavaScript and Rust SDKs

JavaScript SDK:
- Added hybrid search models and validation
- Added hybridSearch method to client
- Added Qdrant compatibility methods (list, get, create collections, upsert/search/delete/retrieve/count points)
- Updated README with hybrid search and Qdrant examples

Rust SDK:
- Added hybrid_search module with SparseVector, HybridSearchRequest, HybridSearchResponse
- Added hybrid_search method to client
- Added Qdrant compatibility methods (same as other SDKs)
- Updated README with hybrid search and Qdrant examples
- Full type safety with serde serialization

All SDKs now support:
- Hybrid search with dense + sparse vectors (RRF, Weighted, Alpha algorithms)
- Full Qdrant REST API compatibility for easy migration
- Consistent API across Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Rust
