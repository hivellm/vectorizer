Reorganize user documentation using Dgeni-style structure with topics

- Created topic-based directory structure:
  - installation/ - Installation guides
  - getting-started/ - Quick start tutorials
  - collections/ - Collection management
  - search/ - Search features and methods
  - sdks/ - Client SDKs documentation
  - service-management/ - Service management
  - configuration/ - Configuration guides
  - troubleshooting/ - Troubleshooting guide

- Added frontmatter YAML metadata to all documents (Dgeni format):
  - title, module, id, order, description, tags
  
- Each document is self-contained with related topics links
- Organized by user workflow and topics
- Removed duplicate files from root
- Updated main README with topic-based navigation

This structure makes it easy to:
- Navigate by topic
- Generate documentation sites with Dgeni
- Maintain and update specific topics independently
- Follow user workflows logically
