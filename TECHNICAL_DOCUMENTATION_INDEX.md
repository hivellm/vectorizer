## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive specification for a secure, high-performance vector database with proper client-server architecture. The design eliminates the conceptual error of local database processing by centralizing all vector operations on the server while providing lightweight, authenticated client SDKs.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Client-Server Model**: Server handles all processing, SDKs are thin clients
- **Mandatory Authentication**: API keys required for all operations
- **Local Dashboard**: Secure key management accessible only from localhost
- **Flexible Deployment**: Internal network or cloud configurations
- **Native Embeddings**: Built-in models avoid external dependencies
- **Memory Optimization**: Quantization support for large-scale deployments

The modular design enables single-codebase maintenance across multiple language SDKs while ensuring enterprise-grade security and performance.
